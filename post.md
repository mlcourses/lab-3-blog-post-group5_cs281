# Lab 03: Creating Sequential Patterns with Digital Circuit Design

## What We Did In The Last Lab

In the last lab - **Intro to Digital Design**, we delved into the intricacies of digital circuits, starting with the creation of a 2 to 1 mux using fundamental logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT gates. Progressing further, we utilized a 74150 mux chip to construct a more sophisticated 4 to 1 mux, ensuring meticulous wiring based on comprehensive diagrams and documentation. Integrating Arduino, we then employed it to control and test the mux's functionality, programming it to manage input data and control lines while validating output accuracy through systematic testing. Lastly, we designed and implemented a 1-bit adder circuit, demonstrating our proficiency in combining logic gates for arithmetic operations.

## Overview and Motivation

In Lab03 - Ramp Circuit, we'll delve into constructing a circuit that displays numbers on a 7-segment LED based on a knob's position, much like a volume control. The lab starts with some groundwork, where we simplify circuit designs and understand how to represent numbers using a special kind of light display. The main part of the lab involves building a "ramp circuit," which means that as we turn the knob, the numbers displayed on the LED will gradually increase or decrease. We use a device called an Arduino to help with this, which turns the knob's movement into a digital signal. Then, we'll figure out how to use this digital signal to light up the correct LEDs on the 7-segment display. It's a mix of figuring out how to talk to the Arduino, designing the logic for the LED display, and putting it all together on a breadboard. The challenge is to make sure that as we turn the knob, the right numbers light up on the display.

## Lab Objectives

1. Understand the function and operation of a 7-segment display for digital number representation.

2. Construct truth tables to indicate the outputs for each LED segment ion the 7-segment display. 

3. Use Karnaugh Maps to design and optimize the circuit's logics.

4. Use logisim to design and test a boolean circuit that combines the minimized functions for each LED segment.

5. Construct and test a voltage divider circuit using a potentiometer to generate analog input signals.

6. Implement combinational logic circuits to light up the 7-segment display.

7. Use Arduino to interpret digital signals and power the circuit.
